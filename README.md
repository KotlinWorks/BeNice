# Welcome

*Be nice* is a small Android tool. It can launch apps adjacent to its own window. 

Now, why would you want to do that? Many apps force a portrait screen orientation. This works well on smartphones, but requires users of tablets and foldables to rotate their devices if the preferred orientation of the device is landscape. 

If two apps run side by side, that screen rotation doesn't happen. Therefore, *Be nice* shows a list of apps that want to be used in portrait mode and, upon clicking on the corresponding app, opens it adjacent to the *Be nice* window.

A long tap opens a sheet which allows you to add a link. Doing so will create a so-called pinned shortcut. An icon will be added to your home screen. If you click on it, both *Be nice* and the portrait app are launched.

### Download

Eventually, *Be nice* may be available in Google Play. For now, you need to download the APK from the Releases and sideload it to your device.
